        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>Though I am still new to the development field, I feel that I have already earned a lot of experience that will prove valuble in my career; and in-turn, valuble to my employer as well.</p>

          <ul class="experience-list">
            <li><p>I began working at Mattress Depot as a delivery man in 2013.</p></li>
            <li><p>In a year I began working as a salesman where I truly began to refine my customer service skills and learned the process of selling a customer not only on a product; but on the business and myself as a knowledgeable salesman.</p></li>
            <li><p>In february my boss trusted me with the responsability of controlling the Mattress Depot website hosting and keeping the website up to date with the most recent advertisements and promotions.</p><a href="http://www.mattressdepotalabama.com" target="_blank"><p class="experience-button">See Website Here</p></a></li>
            <li class="experience-summary"><p>From my time at Mattress Depot the valuble skills that i have learned include selling myself and the business I represent, playing damage control by calming down customers when mishaps would occur, dealing with deadlines for online advertisement and giving website statistics reports to my supervior, as well as adding content for new merchandise.</p></li>
